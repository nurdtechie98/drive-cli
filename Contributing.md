## Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Drive-CLI! Here are a few pointers about how you can help.

### Setting things up

To set up the development environment, follow the instructions in README.

### Finding something to work on

The issue tracker of Drive-CLI a good place to start. If you find something that interests you, comment on the thread and we’ll help get you started. Do make sure to get an issue assigned to you before you start working on it.

Alternatively, if you come across a new bug on the site, please file a new issue and comment if you would like to be assigned. The existing issues are tagged with one or more labels, its importance etc., that can help you in selecting one.

If neither of these seem appealing, please post on our channel and we will help find you something else to work on.

### Instructions to submit code

Before you submit code, please talk to us via the issue tracker so we know you are working on it.

Our central development branch is development. Coding is done on feature branches based off of development and merged into it once stable and reviewed. To submit code, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch off of development. Select a descriptive branch name.

        git fetch upstream
        git checkout master
        git merge upstream/master
        git checkout -b your-branch-name

2. Commit and push code to your branch:

    - Commits should be self-contained and contain a descriptive commit message.
    - Please make sure your code is well-formatted.
    - Please ensure that your code is well tested.
    - We highly encourage to use `autopep8` to follow the PEP8 styling. Run the following command before creating the pull request:
            git commit -a -m “{{commit_message}}”
            git push origin {{branch_name}}

3. Once the code is pushed, create a pull request:

    - On your Github fork, select your branch and click “New pull request”. Select “dev” as the base branch and your branch in the “compare” dropdown.
If the code is mergeable (you get a message saying “Able to merge”), go ahead and create the pull request.
    - If your checks have passed, your PR will be assigned a reviewer who will review your code and provide comments. Please address each review comment by pushing new commits to the same branch (the PR will automatically update, so you don’t need to submit a new one). Once you are done, comment below each review comment marking it as “Done”. Feel free to use the thread to have a discussion about comments that you don’t understand completely or don’t agree with.

    - Once all comments are addressed, the reviewer will give an LGTM (‘looks good to me’) and merge the PR.
